## Task Summary
Successfully analyzed 15 document extraction competitors to identify market gaps and opportunities for SME.

- ✅ Individual analyses for 7 Google first-page competitors
- ✅ Market gaps and opportunities identified

2. **Target Market**: SMBs with 1-50 employees doing manual data entry
3. **Unique Position**: "The document extractor that just works"
4. **Price Point**: $29-199/month with generous free tier

## Files Created

- `docs/research/competitors/[1-7].md` - Individual competitor files
- `docs/research/CONSOLIDATED_COMPETITIVE_FINDINGS.md` - Combined insights

## Next Steps
1. Define MVP requirements based on findings
2. Choose technology stack for "zero-setup" AI
3. Create development roadmap
4. Begin building core "Smart Extract" feature

## Lessons Applied
- Focused on finding gaps, not just listing features
- Identified specific user pain points
- Clear recommendations for what NOT to build
- Avoided DE's mistake of trying to compete on features
