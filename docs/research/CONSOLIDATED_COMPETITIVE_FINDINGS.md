## Executive Summary

After analyzing 15 document extraction competitors, we've identified a clear market opportunity: **building a "zero-setup" document extractor for non-technical business users**. The market is split between powerful but complex developer tools and simple but limited template-based solutions. No one is serving the SMB market with truly intelligent, out-of-the-box extraction.

## Key Market Insights

### 1. The Complexity Gap
- **Developer Tools** (Google AI, AWS, Azure): Powerful but require coding, API integration, and technical expertise
- **Template Tools** (Docparser, Parseur): Easier but require manual template creation for each document type
- **Our Opportunity**: Bridge this gap with AI that works immediately, no setup required

### 2. Pricing Transparency Crisis
- Most enterprise tools: "Contact Sales" pricing
- Hidden costs: Setup fees, training, integration costs
- SMBs need: Clear, predictable, monthly pricing

### 3. Common User Complaints Across All Tools
1. **Too complex to set up** - Even "simple" tools require templates
2. **Expensive for small volumes** - High entry prices exclude SMBs
3. **Technical expertise required** - Need developers or IT staff
4. **Poor onboarding** - Takes hours/days to process first document
5. **Limited document types** - Work well for one type, fail on others

## Competitive Landscape Summary

### Google First-Page Competitors (Our Direct Competition)
1. **Adobe Acrobat Extract API** - Enterprise-focused, developer-only, no UI
2. **Assist Bookkeeping AI** - Niche (bookkeeping), good UX but limited scope
3. **Fivetran** - Data pipeline tool, not document-focused, very technical
4. **Extracta.ai** - Simple 3-step process but lacks pricing transparency
5. **Docsumo** - Powerful but complex, 14-day trial required
6. **DocExtractor** - Template-based, lacks AI intelligence
7. **SciSpace Extract** - Research papers only, not business documents
