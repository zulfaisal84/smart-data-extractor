# SME Task Management System

## Workflow Overview

```
CEO (You) â†’ Senior Developer (Me) â†’ Analyze & Assign â†’ Agent Executes â†’ Document Results
```

## Task Assignment Protocol

### When CEO Requests Something:

1. **I will analyze** the request and determine:
   - What needs to be done
   - Which agent(s) are best suited
   - Task dependencies
   - Expected deliverables

2. **I will provide you**:
   - Agent name and role
   - Clear task instructions to copy/paste
   - Expected outcomes
   - Success criteria

3. **You will**:
   - Pass instructions to the assigned agent
   - Share their response back with me
   - I'll review and plan next steps

**Instructions to copy/paste**:
"Create the initial project structure for Smart Data Extractor (SME) web application. We need:

     - controllers/
     - services/
     - models/
     - routes/
     - middleware/
   - tests/
   - config/

2. Initialize package.json with essential dependencies:
   - Express
   - TypeScript
   - Jest for testing
   - Dotenv for configuration

3. Create a basic health check endpoint at GET /health

4. Set up TypeScript configuration

5. Create a README with setup instructions
