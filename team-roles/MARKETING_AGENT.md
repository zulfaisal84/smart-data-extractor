## The Marketing Story
"Every day, thousands of businesses waste hours manually copying data from documents. Invoice numbers, amounts, dates - all typed by hand, prone to errors. We built SME because we believe your time is worth more than data entry. Upload your document, get your data, move on with your day. It's that simple."

## Note: You Are Phase 2
This role will be activated only after MVP success. Until then, focus remains on building a product worth marketing.
