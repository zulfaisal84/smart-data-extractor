# CEO - Role Context

## Who You Are
You are **Muhamad Zulfaisal Salleh Mustafa**, the CEO and visionary behind the Smart Data Extractor (SME) project. You learned valuable lessons from the Data Extractor (DE) project's failures and are determined to build a successful, simple, working document extraction solution.

## Your Mission
Provide clear vision and direction while maintaining laser focus on shipping a minimal, working product. Resist the urge to add features before the core extraction functionality is proven and validated with real users.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Vision & Strategy**
   - Define the product vision
   - Make final decisions on scope
   - Approve/reject features
   - Set priorities
   - Ensure MVP focus

2. **Team Leadership**
   - Communicate only through Senior Developer
   - Provide clear requirements
   - Make timely decisions
   - Remove blockers
   - Keep team motivated

3. **Stakeholder Management**
   - Define success metrics
   - Set timeline expectations
   - Approve major milestones
   - Decide on pivots
   - Manage resources

4. **Quality Control**
   - Final approval on releases
   - User experience decisions
   - Brand and messaging
   - Pricing strategy
   - Go-to-market timing

## Your Workflow

### Communication Protocol:
```
You → Senior Developer (Claude Opus 4) → Specialist Agents
         ↑                                    ↓
         ←─────── Results & Recommendations ←─┘
```

### Daily Process:
1. **Review Progress**: Check TASK_LOG.md updates
2. **Set Priorities**: Tell Senior Developer what's most important
3. **Make Decisions**: Approve/reject recommendations
4. **Remove Blockers**: Solve problems blocking the team
5. **Stay Focused**: Resist feature creep

## Key Files to Monitor
- **CLAUDE.md** - Overall project status
- **TASK_LOG.md** - What's being worked on
- **MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Scope definition (when created)
- **NOT_BUILDING.md** - Features we're avoiding (when created)

## Decision Framework

### When Considering a Feature:
Ask yourself:
1. Is this needed for basic document extraction?
2. Can we launch without it?
3. Have users asked for it?
4. Will it delay our MVP?
5. What would DE do? (Do opposite)

### Feature Request Response:
- **If Core to MVP**: "Yes, add to current sprint"
- **If Nice to Have**: "Add to Phase 2 backlog"
- **If Unclear Value**: "Let's test with users first"
- **If Complex**: "What's a simpler version?"

## Lessons from DE Project

### What You Learned:
1. **Complexity Kills** - DE had 4-panel layouts, floating windows, calibration dashboards
2. **Desktop-First Failed** - Limited reach, platform issues
3. **No Users, No Value** - Built features nobody validated
4. **Perfect Never Ships** - Aimed too high, delivered nothing

### Your New Approach:
1. **Simple First** - One upload, one result
2. **Web Only** - Accessible everywhere
3. **User Validated** - Test every assumption
4. **Ship Weekly** - Incremental progress

## CEO Communication Templates

### Starting a Session:
"Hi, I'm continuing work on SME. Please read team-roles/SENIOR_DEVELOPER.md and CLAUDE.md for context. Current priority is [X]."

### Requesting Work:
"We need to [specific task]. What's your recommendation for approach and who should handle this?"

### Making Decisions:
"After reviewing the options, let's proceed with [decision]. Please prepare instructions for [agent]."

### Scope Protection:
"That's a good idea for Phase 2. For now, let's focus on getting basic extraction working."

## Your Success Metrics

### Phase 1 MVP Success:
- [ ] Upload document works
- [ ] Extract data successfully
- [ ] Display results clearly
- [ ] 10 real users tested
- [ ] Positive feedback received
- [ ] Deployed to production

### Project Success:
- [ ] 100+ active users
- [ ] 90% extraction accuracy
- [ ] Sustainable business model
- [ ] Team running smoothly
- [ ] Clear growth path

## Red Flags to Watch For

### From Team:
- "Let's add this cool feature..."
- "We should build it properly first..."
- "Users will probably want..."
- "While we're at it..."
- "It's almost done, just need..."

### Your Response:
- "Is it needed for MVP?"
- "Let's validate that assumption"
- "Add it to Phase 2 list"
- "What's the simplest version?"
- "Ship what we have first"

## Your Mantras
1. **"Ship something that works"** - Not everything that could work
2. **"Users define value"** - Not our assumptions
3. **"Progress over perfection"** - Weekly improvements
4. **"No is a complete sentence"** - Protect scope
5. **"Remember DE's failures"** - Don't repeat history

## Phase Transitions

### MVP → Growth Conditions:
- Core extraction working reliably
- Positive user feedback
- Clear monetization path
- Team capacity available
- Market validation complete

### Your Role Evolution:
- **Phase 1**: Hands-on scope protection
- **Phase 2**: Strategic growth decisions
- **Phase 3**: Scaling and optimization

## Emergency CEO Decisions

### If Behind Schedule:
Cut features, not quality. Ship smaller MVP.

### If Technical Dispute:
Trust Senior Developer but demand simplicity.

### If User Feedback Negative:
Pivot quickly, fail fast, learn faster.

### If Team Overbuilding:
Stop everything. Reset to core MVP.

### If Investor Pressure:
Show working product, not feature list.

## Session Continuity

When returning after break:
1. Read this file for role reminder
2. Check CLAUDE.md for project status
3. Review TASK_LOG.md for recent progress
4. Set priorities with Senior Developer
5. Continue forward momentum

Remember: **You succeeded by learning from failure. DE failed from complexity. SME succeeds through simplicity. Your job is to ship a simple, working product that solves real problems for real users.**

## The CEO's Prayer
"Grant me the wisdom to ship what users need,
The courage to say no to feature creep,
And the persistence to build something that works."
