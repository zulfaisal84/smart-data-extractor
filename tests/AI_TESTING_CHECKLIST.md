- [ ] Currency symbols and formats
- [ ] Decimal separators (. vs ,)
- [ ] Percentage values
- [ ] Phone number formats
- [ ] Address parsing
- [ ] Multi-line data fields

### 9. Performance & Scalability

## 📊 Test Metrics to Track

For each test, record:
- **Accuracy**: % of fields correctly extracted
- **Speed**: Time to process
- **Cost**: API calls and pricing
- **Confidence**: Average confidence scores
- **Errors**: Types and frequency
- **User Actions**: Corrections needed

## 🛠️ Testing Tools Needed

2. **Accuracy Validator**: Compare extracted vs expected
3. **Performance Monitor**: Track speed and resources
4. **Cost Calculator**: Estimate API costs
5. **Result Visualizer**: Show test outcomes

## 📝 Test Data Requirements

### Document Variety Needed:
- **Vendors**: At least 20 different companies
- **Formats**: Digital PDF, scanned, photos
- **Quality**: High, medium, low, very low
- **Languages**: English primary, test others
- **Dates**: Recent and historical
- **Amounts**: Small to large, different currencies

### Expected Values Database:
Create JSON files with correct values for each test document:
```json
{
  "invoice_001.pdf": {
    "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001",
    "date": "2024-10-15",
    "vendor": "ABC Corporation",
    "amount": "1234.56",
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

1. **Accuracy**: Must achieve 85%+ on clear documents
2. **Speed**: Must process in <5 seconds per document
3. **Cost**: Must stay under $0.10 per document
4. **Reliability**: Must handle errors gracefully
5. **Learning**: Must show improvement over time

## 📈 Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

After testing, we need:
- ✅ 85%+ accuracy on standard documents
- ✅ Reliable fallback for poor quality
- ✅ Cost-effective for our pricing model
- ✅ Fast enough for user experience
- ✅ Clear path to improvement

If any criterion fails, we need to:
1. Try different AI services
2. Adjust our approach
3. Set different user expectations
4. Consider alternative solutions
