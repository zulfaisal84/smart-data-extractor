3. QA tests feature
4. DevOps validates deployment
5. Merge to main

### Documentation Updates
- Every feature requires docs
- Documentation Maintainer reviews weekly
- All decisions recorded in PROJECT_DECISIONS.md

### Escalation Path
Developer Issue → Senior Developer → Product Manager → CEO

## Phase Gates

### MVP Complete Criteria
- [ ] Upload document works
- [ ] Extract data successfully
- [ ] Display results clearly
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] 10 real users tested
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Phase 2 Entry Criteria
- [ ] MVP stable for 2 weeks
- [ ] Core features bug-free
- [ ] Positive user feedback

## Model Selection Rationale

**Opus 4 (Senior Developer)**: Complex reasoning, architecture decisions, code review
**Sonnet 4 (Execution Roles)**: Fast, efficient implementation and testing
**Gemini CLI (Research Roles)**: Cost-effective for analysis and content generation

## Key Success Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Basic upload → extract → display
2. **Test Everything**: No feature without tests
3. **Deploy Early**: Production from week 1
4. **Say No**: Reject feature requests until MVP done
5. **Document Always**: Every decision recorded
6. **User Validation**: Test with real users early

## What We're NOT Building (Phase 1)
- Complex UI layouts
- Multiple extraction methods
- User accounts/authentication
- Batch processing
- API endpoints for external use
- Mobile apps
- Advanced analytics

Remember: DE failed from trying to do too much. We succeed by doing one thing well.
